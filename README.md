# About

This is a simple watchface that displays the current time in 24-hour text, as one might read it out
loud.

For example, 9:00am (in 12-hour time) becomes "zero nine hundred hours".

This is largely designed to be compiled with the standard "waf" toolchain, and can also be
easily imported into [Cloudpebble](http://www.cloudpebble.net), the latter of which I highly
recommend for easy and quick compilation without having to worry about your local toolchain.
